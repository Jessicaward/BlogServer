# Blog Server
Server for my personal website. Backend written in Golang. Front end is vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript (because I'm not a hip young JavaScript developer going through like 10 libraries a week).

## Random Album Generator
Generates a list of random albums (from my list of like 5000+ albums on Last.fm).

[Follow my Last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/jessicaward25)
 
## Blog
This will serve as a place to put thoughts, articles, whatever I want I guess.

## Portfolio
It's always useful to have an updated portfolio. I do a lot of work outside of my programming job, so I'd like to keep track of everything.

## Random Link Section
Random links to articles, videos, useful sites etc that I find.

## Projects
Place to link music projects, code projects, recent endeavours etc ðŸ˜Ž
