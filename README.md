## Blog
This will serve as a place to put thoughts, articles, whatever I want I guess.

## Portfolio
It's always useful to have an updated portfolio. I do a lot of work outside of my programming job, so I'd like to keep track of everything.

## Random link section
Random links to articles, videos, useful sites etc that I find.
